# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

We have now added the functionality to sign in and register with a google account. And also started the process of implementing courses into our project. Admins can now create, view, edit and delete courses. Professors are also able to view a list of course info, without viewing notes. To make creating a course as easy as possible for an administrator, We decided instead of having the administrator having to know the professors Name and UnID before creating the course. We created a drop down menu for the professor's UnID that displays the professor's full name and UnID. This enables the Admin to quickly and easily select which professor is teaching the course.
