# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

We have now added the functionality for users to view, and update their availability. We have implemented this in a very similar way as seen in the assignment details. One design choice we made is not adding the ability for dragging. We saw the issues that can arise in Lecture, such as having inconsistent selection, and causing troubles for the user. We do not expect a user to have too much availability, or have to update this often, therefore, just selecting each time slot is fine in our eyes. 

# Comments to Evaluators:

As of submitting this assignment we are not aware of any bugs. We have updated the grading links in the nav bar for this assignment as listed in the assignment details. We did layout our JavaScript a bit different than what is described in the assignment details. We followed the example website provided by the professor, and made many seperate JavaScript classes. We think this makes things more understandable, rather than the single class which does everything described in the assignment details. We use AvailabilityTracker.js to hold our setup function, which then constructs our individual components which are defined as their own JavaScript classes. 

# Assignment Specific Topics

Above and Beyond

We have mostly focused on a working solution, and have not done much beyond the assignment details. We decided to simplify access to this page, by only allowing Applicants to view it, and then showing the logged in user their availability. This limits the need for parameters withn the link, and you can easily navigate to the page. We have added a button within viewing your application to set your availability. We feel this is useful as when you complete the application, you will see this button and can complete this step.

# Consulted Peers:

Due to working on this assignment as a pair, there was no reason for communication
between peers outside of this partnership to complete the assignment.

# Peers Helped:

No peers approached our partnership or either of us individually for assistance in their own assignment.
