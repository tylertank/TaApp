# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

We have now added the functionality for the admin to view data trends about course enrollments for specific time ranges. They are able to see the enrollments over time for different classes at a single time using the default trends page. Or see total enrollments for multiple classes as of the current day using the pie chart trends page. We both feel that we are finally getting the hang of javascript and felt pretty good at transferring data to and from the database, controller, and views. 

# Comments to Evaluators:

As of submitting this assignment we are not aware of any bugs. We have updated the grading links in the nav bar for this assignment as listed in the assignment details. We have implemented the line chart in a way where multiple lines can be added, and you can add the same course multiple times. We do not remove any series, as we want the admin to build up a graph, using the dates and courses they want. This can build a graph with many lines, with differing starts and end dates. Please observe our extra pie chart page through the TA links.

# Assignment Specific Topics

Above and Beyond

We added a second page to hold the enrollment pie chart trends for one of the above and beyond requirements. The pie chart shows the most recent enrollment value from today, and you can add multiple courses to compare their current enrollments. For the second requirment we deployed our system to AWS.
